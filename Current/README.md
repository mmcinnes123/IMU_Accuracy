This series of scripts allows the reading of Motion Monitor report file (quaternions) of one or more IMUs and an OMC cluster. 

The IMU and cluster quaternions can be transformed/adjusted in various ways in order to directly compare quaternion orientations at each time sample. 

Various outputs can be used to analyse results - Euler angles, RMSE based on quaternions, vector angle projections etc.

main.py can combined multiple repetitions to find average RMSE results.
